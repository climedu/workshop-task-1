Here is a URL to the webpage for this project: https://climedu.github.io/workshop-task-1/

## Task
- Make a p5.js sketch using 2D primitive shapes, loops, and random numbers.
- Write your own functions and make calls to these functions in your code.
- Experiment with at least one new item the p5.js documentation links to an external site.
- Keep notes to document your process and learning clearly.

## Overview
- Moving the rectangle left and right with conditional
- Loop function
- Turn combined shapes into a function
- Learn random positions and heights/size
- Experimenting with the odd and even for changing the colour

## Workshop Notes

Shortcuts: 
- cmd + / to select every lines need "//"

Main 5 founding priciples :
- Variables, conditionals, loops, functions, and objects
- Looking more about variables, conditions then focus on loops and functions. 


### Code Notes (Workshop):
Rectangle (moving right and left) - conditional (If)
- Instead of stuck on the right side, need a command that says if reaching point a do this, point b do this
- Code :

Loop of drawing rectangles, keep drawing until there's a command to say stop.

Making a shape from combinations of geometries. In this case, triangle and rectangle. Make them into a function so that it can be input inside to another function.

I did some experiments from the existing code, changing a point of the triangle.

The random lollipops from the workshop code

## Task Journey
From the lollipop code, I'm experimenting with another shape that I want to develop further. So, the lollipop only has the random heights of the rectangle and position. I want to experiment with a whole image with 2 rectangles and 2 half circles. The 2 rectangles have random heights that go to the opposite y direction.

### Process 2

V.2 (next version) trying to make it in the centre (x line by dividing the heights of the canvas into 2 (y line)), and more tidy, but still having the random heights (make loop).

Great, the next development is to make the colours red and green based on odd and even numbers. Trying to find out how to use division. Turned out using % and ==

### Process 3
Making the colours red and green based on odd and even colour
Learning the odd and even from this web :  https://editor.p5js.org/togekisse/sketches/eQ3hatG0f

- Struggle -> don't know how to put the organize since there will be "for" 1 for the geometry set up to add 1 every 50 (
	  for (x=0;  x < width; x += 50){
	    geometry(x, centerY, random(0,200), color("green"));
	  }) and needed another for the odd and even number.
- Asked chat gpt, and came out a code with this difference "
	  for (let i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
	    let x = i * 50; // Calculate the x position
	    let colorChoice = (i % 2 === 0) ? color("green") : color("red"); // Alternate colors
	    geometry(x, centerY, random(50, 150), colorChoice);
	  }
- Learned that instead of using an if statement, this one can function by making them as variables. Make the x position x as a variable which adding 1 each 50 pixel, and variable for choosing the color based on odd and even.
- Make the random(50,150) to make the range of the random height and looks more organized which the range is 50px to 150px

Code :

Result :

### Commentaries
- Learned new things about odd and even
- Learned a new thing about dividing canvas height into 2

## Future Development
- Make the rectangle longer upwards and downwards, then coming back to the centre
- Or maybe changing the color every few seconds
